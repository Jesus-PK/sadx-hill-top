# SADX Hill Top
An Adventure-style version of Sonic 2's Hill Top Zone.

This mod serves as an example of a full custom level: it adds custom geometry, objects, enemies, cameras and musics as well as a boss and a level event. It also shows how to make configurations, how to use the game functions, how to create geometry/shape collisions, etc.
It is meant to show the potential of dll modding. I am not a level designer, but I tried my best to make it entertaining.
